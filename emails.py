    <p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>

    <p>Hope you're having a good week.</p>

    <p>My name is Thushan Madarasinghe, a Computer Science undergraduate at the Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT), affiliated with the University of Westminster. I'm writing to express my strong interest in an internship opportunity with your esteemed organization.</p>

    <p>I'm genuinely impressed by your company's commitment to excellence and nurturing new talent. I'm eager to contribute to the impactful work you're doing, which feels like a fantastic next step for me.</p>

    <p>My studies have provided a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Programming, Algorithms, and Data Structures. I'm proficient in technologies including Java, React Native, Node.js, Express.js, React, MongoDB, SQL, and HTML/CSS, and I'm comfortable with Git for version control. I also have a good understanding of backend development, including APIs and database management.</p>

    <p>I enjoy tackling new technologies and figuring things out across the full stack, bringing different components together to build functional solutions.</p>

    <p>Key projects I've worked on include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>GoviShakthi:</strong> An AI-powered MERN stack app with LLM integration for product recommendations.</li>
      <li><strong>FinTrack:</strong> A personal finance tracker built with the MERN stack.</li>
      <li><strong>Real-Time Ticketing System:</strong> Developed using Node.js, React.js, and WebSockets.</li>
      <li><strong>Plane Management System:</strong> A project built using Java.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>My involvement with the IEEE Computer Society at university has also enhanced my communication, organization, and teamwork skills through various events.</p>

    <p>I'm eager to bring my energy, technical skills, and passion for learning to your team. Please find my CV attached for your review. I would be grateful for the chance to discuss how I could contribute. If there aren't any suitable openings right now, I'd be thankful if you'd keep my application in mind and let me know about any future opportunities that might come up.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>
